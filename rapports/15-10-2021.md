Today was our first day with the company that created the "CoolGames" project : STMicroelectronics.
Enginners from STMicroelectronics presented us the following specifications of this project :

The first one is the design of a system that is able to recognize object thanks to the STM32H747I-DISCO card and the B-CAM-OMV camera.
The second one is a product that tells the customer wich object he is facing. We assert that the customer is blind. The customer needs to hear wich direction he has to go and wich items he is facing thanks to this product.
We know for sure, that we have to create at least two neuronal networks. Each of them will be designed to recognize objects from a special category.

We shall have finished our networks before April.
Then in April and May we will advertise our project on the internet.
The competition will happened at the end of May.
